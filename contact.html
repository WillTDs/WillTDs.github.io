        <h3>About</h3>
        <img src="#">
        <p>Coming from a background in gardening and having worked multiple jobs in the horticultural industry, I increasingly felt the need for a different challenge. So I looked into whether I could move into working in another old hobby of mine, coding. I used to play around trying to make websites in the late 90s but never really did anything with it after that, as at the time I didn’t believe it to be a viable career path.</p>

        <p>I enjoy problem solving and creativity, and I’ve found web development to be the perfect marriage of the two. With that in mind I made the decision that it’s what I want to do with my life, so I joined General Assembly’s WDI course in August 17. I’ve really enjoyed the course and its concreted my belief that this is the path I want to take.</p>

        <p>I’m excited to pursue a career in web development, and want to work for a company that will support my ambition and continue learning within a team of like-minded people that I could grow from.</p>
